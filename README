You need Python 2.7+, uncrustify and a recent Git to run this.

- Adjust the path to uncrustify in uncrustify.py
- unxz the dump file in dumps
- run reposurgeon
- In reposurgeon, run "script dune-grid.rs"
- Get a coffee! ;-)
- When it's done, close reposurgeon with CTRL-D
- The converted repository is in dune-grid.git

The conversion process places two log files in the current directory,
one containing the blobs that could not be reindented and one containing
the blobs that were left untouched. The contents of the files is the
"event id" used by reposurgeon for the blob and all the file paths the
blob is know as.

The log files for my conversion run are in the directory dune-grid-logs
